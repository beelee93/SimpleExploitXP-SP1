This program demonstrates the simple stack-smashing exploit that is
popular with so many malwares. This exploit works well on insecure
computers, especially those running the older operating systems with
no patches or updates. 

(Hence, this exploit will not work unless you have Windows XP SP1)

==============================
main.c
==============================

The main source code of the vulnerable program. The flaw arises from the 
readFileToScreen function, in which the opened file will be read until 
to the end, placing each character read into the buffer that is given 
a limited size. 

Since this buffer is created in the stack, a large enough file can 
override the stack so much that return pointers can be altered. This can
then be used to direct the execution to an arbitrary code.

==============================
good.data
==============================

A good text file to be used as input to show the proper working of the
program.

==============================
calc.data
==============================

Using this file as input will cause calculator to run, an unintended 
outcome of the program (demonstrates arbitrary code execution).

==============================
test.exe
==============================

When the app is run, type the path to the input file.
